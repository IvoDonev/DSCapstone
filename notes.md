Abandonment is a cycle in stages and a process
Functional abandonment - closing off doors, vacancy, utility shut down
Financial abandonment - accumulation of debt, not paying for it...
Physical abandonment - lack of upkeep, health code violations. May have squatters

Data is time sensitive as people can move in and out of buildings, neighborhoods can improve and deteriorate etc, so predictive models need to keep up to date. The format of data can keep changing is often comes from third party sources

## Spatial Autocorrelation
similar values of 

Positive spatial autocorrelation is when similar values cluster together in a map.
Negative spatial autocorrelation is when dissimilar values cluster together in a map.

What scale to use to consider areas together depends mainly on availability. Denisity maps allow to resample areas to consider size effects


Highest indicators:
properties determined vacant by foot survey
house code violation properties
properties owned by the city
no water supply 

# Notes about Morckel - spatial characteristics of housing abandonment

This author suspects that abandonment clusters because the predictors of abandonment cluster. For example: property value and age since neighborhoods are built at one time with a similar style. 

Location specific housing demand (or lack of)
Poverty and racial characteristics cluster and since they are predicitors....
